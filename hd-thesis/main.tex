\begin{dissertationabstract}
	
	Cryptographic standards published by organizations like NIST, ISO, and the
	IETF provide guidance for developers choosing and implementing cryptographic
	algorithms for their applications. In recent years, formal proofs of security
	have become an important part of validation for standardized algorithms;
	however, these proofs rely on abstractions which sometimes differ
	significantly from the schemes and protocols used in practice.

	In this work, I will begin with a study of the ongoing NIST standardization
	process of post-quantum key-encapsulation mechanisms and highlight
	vulnerabilities in several (former) candidate algorithms which arise from a
	systematic mismatch between abstract primitives used in cryptographic models
	 and their actual instantiation in implementations. I will then present a
	 library of secure instantiation techniques and a way to extend schemes'
	 existing proofs to their instantiations. Next, I will address the Transport
	Layer Security (TLS 1.3) Handshake Protocol and demonstrate by a concrete
	evaluation that prior work fails to prove practical security levels for many
	of the standardized parameter sets. I will then show tighter proofs that do
	justify these parameter sets and which additionally give the first fully
	justified abstraction of the TLS 1.3 key schedule in the random oracle model,
	and I will explain how certain parts of the TLS 1.3 design hinder the
	application of useful abstractions.
	
	I will also explain how inaccurate portrayals of hash functions in the random
	oracle model impact the security analysis of the standardized EdDSA signature
	scheme and present an improved proof of security with better tightness and modularity.
	I conclude by introducing my work on the proposed standard for privacy-preserving
	measurement, including a new security model for Verifiable Distributed
	Aggregation Functions. Within this model, I discuss results for Prio3, an optimized
	version of the massively scalable, widely used Prio construction for private
	data collection, and Doplar, a new construction for private histogram generation.

%\chapter{Figures and Such}
%This demonstrates how OGS wants figures and tables formatted. For
%figures, the caption goes below the figure and ``Figure'' is in bold.
%See Figure~\ref{fig:zen}. Tables are formatted with the caption above
%the table. See Table~\ref{tab:bad}.
%
%Of course, Table~\ref{tab:bad} looks horrible. It should probably be
%formatted like Table~\ref{tab:good} instead.
%
%For facing caption pages, see Table~\ref{tab:facing}. Of course,
%facing caption pages are vaguely ridiculous and my implementation of
%them in the class file is by far the most brittle part of the
%implementation. It's entirely possible that something has changed and
%these don't work at all. I implemented it merely for the challenge.
