\section{Multi-user security} \label{sec-mu}


Here we extend the prior results to the multi-user setting. Describe how this is done without full details. Play around to see what level of detail works. What definitions do we need to give? Can we sketch them in text? We should define the filter carefully. Then discuss how the theorems extend.


\section{Other applications}

Applications to PSS, sphincs+, Tesla and so on.
