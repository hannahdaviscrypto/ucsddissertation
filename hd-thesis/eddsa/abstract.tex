We consider a transform, called Derive-then-Derandomize, that hardens a given
signature scheme against randomness failure and implementation error.
We prove that it works. We then give a general lemma showing indifferentiability of $\ShrinkMD$, a class of constructions that apply a shrinking output transform to an MD-style hash function.
Armed with these tools, we give new
proofs for the widely standardized
and used $\EdDSA$ signature scheme, improving prior work in two ways:
(1) we give proofs for the case that the hash function is an MD-style one,
reflecting the use of SHA512 in the NIST standard, and (2)
we improve the tightness of the reduction so that one has guarantees for group
sizes in actual use.
