\section{Group Instantiation for Ed25519\label{sec-gp-instantiation}}
Ed25519 is EdDSA with twisted Edwards
curve which is birationally equivalent to the curve Curve25519. Curve25519 is of Montgomery form with equation $v^2 = u^3 + 486662u^2 + u$ over the field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and it is birationally equivalent to the Edwards curve $x^2 + y^2 = 1 + (121665/121666)x^2y^2$ where $x = \sqrt{486664}u/v$ and $y = (u - 1)/(u + 1)$. 

In general EdDSA, the group is the set of points on an Edwards curve $E$, namely the $E(\mathbb{F}_q) = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q : -x^2 + y^2 = 1 + dx^2y^2\}$. The Edwards curve in Ed25519 is isomorphic to $-x^2 + y^2 = 1 - (121665/121666)x^2y^2$, and so it has $d = - (121665/121666) \in \mathbb{F}_q$. Then defines $\group$ to be $E(\mathbb{F}_q) = \{(x, y) \in \mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q : -x^2 + y^2 = 1 - (121665/121666)x^2y^2\}$. The field size $q$ is the prime $2^{255} - 19$. Other parameters of the group descriptor include the following: $\cofactor = 3$ is the $\log_2$ of cofactor $2^{\cofactor}$; $\Prime = 2^{252} + 27742317777372353535851937790883648493$ is the odd prime order of subgroup $\group_{\Prime}$; $\generator = (x, 4/5) \in E$ is the generator of $\group_{\Prime}$, and $\Prime \cdot \generator = 0$. The exact implementation of Ed25519 also fixes $b = 256$ and $\HASH$ function to be SHA-512 such that the output of $\HASH$ is $2b$ bits. 

For an elliptic curve point $(x, y)$, the encoding function $\EncF$ encodes it as the $(b-1)$-bit little-endian encoding of $y$ followed by a sign bit of $x$. The sign bit is 1 if and only if $x$ is negative and $x$ is negative if its $(b-1)$-bit encoding is lexicographically larger than that of $-x$. The output length $\EncL$ is therefore $b = 256$. For decoding, $\DecF$ recovers $y$ immediately from its $(b-1)$-bit encoding, and then recovers $x$ via $x = \pm \sqrt{(y^2 - 1)/(dy^2 + 1)}$ and the sign bit. If the resulting point is not on the curve or if taking the square root fails, $\DecF$ returns $\bot$.
