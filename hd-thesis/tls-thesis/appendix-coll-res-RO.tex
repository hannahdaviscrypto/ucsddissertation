\section{Collision Resistance of Random Oracles}
\label{app:coll-res-ro}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:coll-res-ro}
	Let $\RO$ be a random oracle with output length $\hashlen$ and let $\advA$ be any adversary issuing at most $\qRO$ many queries to $\RO$.
	Then,
	\[
		\genAdv{\CR}{\RO}{\qRO} \leq \frac{\qRO^2}{2^\hashlen}.
	\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	The above theorem follows from the birthday bound.
	Since there are at most $\qRO$ queries issued to $\RO$, in the worst case each of these queries is distinct.
	That is, the random oracle~$\RO$ has to sample $\qRO$ many uniform and independent bit strings from $\bits^\hashlen$.
	The probability that two of these bit strings collide can be limited using the birthday bound by $\qRO^2 \cdot 2^{-\hashlen}$.
\end{proof}
